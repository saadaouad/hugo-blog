To reset your redux store you should write a root reduce to delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by `combineReducers()`. Whenever it receives `SIGN_OUT_COMPLETE` action, it returns the initial state.

We can consider this is your main reducer:
```
const todoApp = combineReducers({
  /* your app’s top-level reducers */
})
```

You can write a `rootReducer` delegating to it:

```
const todoApp = combineReducers({
  /* your app’s top-level reducers */
})

const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
  return todoApp(state, action)
}
```

Now we just need to inform the `rootReducer` to return the initial state after `SIGN_OUT_COMPLETE` action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with `undefined` as the first argument.

```
const todoApp = combineReducers({
  /* your app’s top-level reducers */
})

const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'SIGN_OUT_COMPLETE') {
    state = undefined
  }

  return todoApp(state, action)
}
```
