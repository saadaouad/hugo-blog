There is one way to do that would be to write a root reducer in your application.

The root reducer would normally delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by `combineReducers()`. Whenever it receives `SIGN_OUT_COMPLETE` action, it returns the initial state. ðŸŽ‰

We can consider this is your main reducer:
```
const todoApp = combineReducers({
  /* your appâ€™s top-level reducers */
})
```
