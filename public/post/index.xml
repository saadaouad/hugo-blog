      <description>On this post i want to share with you my favorite quotes on design üé®

      <description>It‚Äôs time to Get Real. Getting Real is a smaller, faster, better way to build software.
Getting real is about skipping all the stuff that represents real (charts, graphs, boxes, arrows, schematics, wireframes, etc.) and actually building the real thing.
Getting real is less. Less mass, less software, less features, less paperwork, less of everything that&amp;rsquo;s not essential (and most of what you think is essential actually isn&amp;rsquo;t).
Getting real is staying small and being agile.</description>

      <title>What is Redux</title>

      <description>Redux is a JavaScript library that aims to manage stateful data. The state of your whole application is stored in a single JS object called store. A single function, the reducer, is responsible for making modifications to the store. We trigger the reducer by dispatching an action, a JS object that describes how our data should change. The reducer function receives the action as an argument and makes changes accordingly. Other parts of the code (usually React Components) can subscribe to data in the store.</description>

      <description>Never stop learning They never show that, they never teach that in school, you get your degree and then you work from 9am to 5pm, you go to the home, No!‚Ä®Every good engineer, i guarantee you they go home, they work, they study, so that when it comes time to learn new things, they know all about it already. And that, to me, is my road to mastery for any sort of technology.</description>
